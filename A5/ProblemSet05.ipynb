Do not delete any answer cell and/or add a new one to replace it. If you do so by accident, download a new copy of the problem set's notebook and transfer your answers into it. You can introduce new 'coding' cells in an effort to test approaches to problems, however, these introduced cells will not be considered when grading.\n",
